            <p class="aboutme">I am currently living in San Rafael, CA and have been involved within the research and consulting field for more than five years. I recently switched my career to Front-End Development due to an internal project at my company that I had been involved with focusing on UI. My background in research methodology, working with clients towards a solution as well as my undergraduate degree in Graphic Design, has been highly beneficial in making such a transition into this exciting field.<br><br> 
I have my MA in International Studies and my BS in Graphic Design. I recently finished a Front-End Development course at Learning Fuse based in Irvine, CA. The focus was on HTML5 CSS3 and JavaScript. </p>
